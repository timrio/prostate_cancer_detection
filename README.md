# prostate_cancer_detection

This repo contains our work for the Deep Learning for medical imaging (MVA/centrale) course Kaggle Challenge.
It contains two notebooks:
- tiling and embeddings: to compute tiles from WSI images and compute their embeddings
- training: to train the various deep learning models and compute the final predictions
